# sentiment_analysis_NLP

In this notebook I'll build a sentiment analysis model which classifies IMDB text reviews as either positive or negative

Dataset link [IMDB](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
This dataset contains 25000 train reviews and 25000 test reviews, these reviews are equally balanced

I'll be using the following models to classify reviews:

Naive Bayes
Neural networks
